Why do gun shops carry so many guns they don't recommend buying? ,"Over the years I've noticed gun shop owners and staff tend to try and sway a customer from buying a particular firearm for all kinds of reasons. 

At first, I thought it was just for sales purposes. When I turned 21, I wanted to buy a Glock 19. A shop owner then proceeded to tell me the following paraphrased statement: *""Glocks are good guns but I promise you won't go wrong with a 1911. This is my Nighthawk 1911. It has multiple safety features including the beaver tail safety here, a traditional safety, a de-cocker, and will not fire if the slide is pushed back slightly. The .45 ACP is also the best pistol round out there. It's more likely to be a one-hit kill than 9mm and that's precisely why more Medal of Honor recipients carried a 1911 than any other pistol.""* 

IMO that's a weak argument. If I shoot the leg, is that a one-hit kill? Or if a guy gets hit in the brain stem with .45 ACP, is he ""more dead"" than if he were hit with 9mm? Also, if a gun was around for almost 100 years before other side arms were even invented, it doesn't mean it was better. Not to mention, I'm 90% certain the MoH recipient was likely not using the 1911 for the action that got them the medal in the first place. Even if it was, pretty sure it was because the 1911 was just what happened to be available at that point in history and nothing else.

I didn't buy it and shopped elsewhere, since he just kept trying to get me to buy a 1911 be it Kimber, Nighthawk, or Colt. 

And then I remembered trying to buy a Steyr AUG. This time, the employee was a real prick and said, *""why do you want that thing!? That costs $2000. You want a Springfield Saint so you can get more bang for your buck. Plus, bull-pup triggers suck.""* I admit my answer was kinda sparky when I said, *""I want it because I want it. I already have an AR-15. Why do I even need to explain?""* And thus he proceeds to go on a rant about overpriced guns and buying American, as his shop buddies agreed. That was the first time I ever witnessed a business not wanting to make a profit. 

Oftentimes, I see the guns people on here call gimmick guns like the Desert Eagle or the Judge out in glass cases at gun shops. And I consistently overhear the owners and employees tell prospective buyers, *""trust me, you don't want that gun.""* And mind you, those people just seemed to want a range toy. 

I can understand why a shop owner would have someone looking for a CC pistol steer away from a large pistol like say Beretta 92fs. But it doesn't make sense to tell someone it's a PoS regardless what theyre looking for, when you bothered to keep it in stock.

I'm new to conceal carry. Can someone please tell me how TF you sit down comfortably? ,"Yeah, I'm having one hell of a time justifying carrying this gun with me. Any pointers?

Edit: I'm carrying a smith and wesson m&p shield plus 9mm with an eclipse holster. I've tried 12 o'clock, appendix, and all angles between these two positions (high, low, cant, etc), and i have a claw thing. 

Update: I tried carrying it at around 12:10, and it seemed to work. What really helped was that I set the clip low on the holster, where it made my gun ride really high. As far as comfort, this is where it seems to be at for me. The only problem is that the holster wants to jump out of my pants constantly. The belt helps with that a bit, though.",Spartan0618,222,257,1734732847.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1hiv7n4/im_new_to_conceal_carry_can_someone_please_tell/
Carrying with a Chambered Round,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/s/qQcNYEEUwP

I looked for a post on this, but it was a little dated. Apologies if I missed something in the search.

I've been carrying with a chambered round and I thought that was the right thing to do.

If I'm carrying and a situation were to occur that required I use it, I need to use my pistol as quickly as possible.

Is this correct? I'm new but I learned my safety, grip, and stance first. I feel very confident when I draw my weapon that my finger is going down the slide and not into my trigger guard.

If any one has a good argument for one or the other, I'd like to hear it. I can see the safety side of the issue, but it doesn't outweigh my belief being able to shoot as soon as possible.

Anyway, using a S&W M&P 9 Shield EZ 2.0, left handed shooter so I moved the clip release button to the other side myself (not flexing, first modification and the right one!).

The best thing I have ever read pertaining to concealed carry. This should be a required read for anyone wanting to carry concealed.,"Disclaimer: I'm sure this is a cross-post from somewhere, but it's worth it to read.

As a gun owner, you have to be cool-headed, more-so than the police ever have to be.
And you do not *ever* run around pretending to be the police while carrying a gun because then, shit like this can happen.
You do not start shit, act aggressively, flip the bird, roll your eyes, talk shit, or even raise your voice. *To anyone.* **Ever.**

A combat instructor (who happened to be Buddhist and a Marine) once said to me: ""From now on, when dealing with (ed.) crazy / possibly violent people, you will lose every argument. You are *always* wrong. You are sorry for impinging on their day. You will apologize and apologize again. You *will* back the fuck down. You *will* put your tail between your legs. You *will* let them talk shit about your ladyfriend. You *will* let them call your mother a bitch and a whore and your dad a bastard. You have no ego. ""
""You do all this because if you are the one to start a fight, by default that fight now has a gun in it, and if you start losing, you're going to pull it and kill him. And even if you don't go to jail because you could convince the jury that it was self-defense, you're going to have to live with the fact that you could have saved someone's life and yet you let your ego kill someone.""
""You are not the police, so don't act like them. Though all of you [civilians] are better shots than the police, you do not have the training, the continuum of force policy, or a union plus free lawyers protecting you if you screw up.""

ed: He also said: ""but after backing down and trying to apologize, if at any time you then feel your life or that of a loved one is in danger, put three rounds into his [cardiothoracic] vault, call the police, give a statement, go home, and sleep like a baby. You did all you could for your attacker, and he was the one that made the final decision...

... to kill himself.""

Cross-post aside; make sure you take the responsibility of carrying a weapon seriously. All of our rights depend on it. DO NOT give chances to people when your life is in danger, but DO NOT let your ego, or your pride kill someone.

Edit: returned post to original content.

Edit 2: People have been adding that you shouldn't talk to the police up front, but should in fact get a lawyer. I have to agree with this recommendation. Don't let your adrenaline make you do silly things. Keep your head level, and lawyer up (while remaining respectful to LE personnel).",sh3llsh0ck,2344,695,1350371231.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/11k68p/the_best_thing_i_have_ever_read_pertaining_to/

Why Harry Potter should have carried an M1911,"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out:  Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk?  Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express.  Worried about its Medusa-gaze?  Wear night vision goggles.  The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes.  You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters?  Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds.  Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons.  Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins.  God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say:  ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!""  Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies).  But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill.  I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that.  Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core.  Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second.  Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. 

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

"Have been open carrying in a very anti gun town - these were my ""encounters.""","I recently got my carry permit and decided that I don't really mind open carrying. My small MN town is very anti gun and I have never in my years of being here seen a person openly carry. 

Anyways, my experience overall has been good over about a week. It's a bit nerve wracking at first, but I don't really mind. Overall I only had about 4 things that were ""interesting.""

1) I was in an ice cream shop with some friends. As I walked out there was a family sitting by the door. The little boy instantly screamed ""Look mommy he has a gun!!"" The entire restaurant looked at me, but I just kept walking. As I got on my motorcycle, everyone sitting by the window was staring at me the entire time, as if I was about to commit a crime.

2) In my other daily activities, a guy ran up to me and asked if I could speak with him. He then asks me if I am a police officer. I tell him no, thinking he is about to give me a piece of his mind. He ends up asking me about open carrying and how I have the guts to do it. He had his carry permit, but was worried that he would get kicked out of places. I just gave him my opinion and it ended very positively.

3) Police officers eyed me up at the store, and somewhat followed me to my car. I'm sure they ran my plates but we never had any contact.

4) Went to a different store, with very relaxed employees. As I was paying for the item one of them joked ""you better give him that stuff for free, or else something bad might happen!""

Overall I would recommend trying open carry for those who support it, and I just wanted to give some real life examples of what happened!

How do/would you carry while camping?,"I frequently camp in nearby National Forests deep into the woods and always carry my Glock 19 whether I'm in a small group or I go solo. However, I have always conceal carried since that is the normal for me. But over the past few trips I've made, I've noticed it seems more cumbersome and sometimes painful than it's worth to conceal. All the moving around, chopping up firewood, setting up camp, tending to the fire, etc really gets me sore from the gun pressing into my body.

I will usually run into a few people at or near my campsite who 99% of the time are friendly, but I have interacted with some very questionable folks. I have gone back and forth on whether open carrying in this setting, in contrast to a more ""urban"" environment, is worth it. I would be much more comfortable in my campsite tasks and enjoy my time a bit more, but it could attract unwanted attention. Curious what y'alls opinion on CC/OC in nature would be...

Range Officers Carry Gun,"I went to the indoor range today and I was talking with a range officer. 

Today it was just me and him for awhile so he unholstered his gun, showed it to me and let me fire it. It was a SIG SP2022. Here's the crazy thing, he was carrying it in single action with no manual safety. Does the SP2022 have that DAK trigger or something. I asked him about it and he said the other employees at the range give him shit about carrying it in Single Action but he doesnt care.

Sig Sauer P320 banned by the Denver Police Department,"Basically, what the title says. 

  
The range called everyone who has qualified with a P320 last Friday night and told them that as of immediately the P320 is ""No longer considered safe for Duty or Backup carry"". The Range staff said they were able to replicate malfunctions that caused a discharge without a finger on the trigger. They did say that they are in talks with Sig, and if they can devise a fix they'll reevaluate the gun. This decision did not include the p365 which is still on the approved weapons list. 

  
This is frustrating for me because I finally traded up for a P320 and it's a champ, and now it's a paperweight. I like the way it fits my hand, the low recoil, the accuracy... everything. It came out of the box feeling as broken in as my last pistol took five years to get to.

I posted this on r/SigSauer hoping for some info, but apparently they're very sensitive over there and gave me a permanent ban and removed the post, citing ""Moderator Discretion"" and offering no explanation. I'm hoping that there's some industry insider information here, and someone can share some good news that might get that thing back on my hip.
